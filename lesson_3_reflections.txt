When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to share your work with others for their benefit or you want to collaborate with
other developers on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There may be code in the GitHub repo which you are not ready to incorporate into you code yet. You want to wait until you're done installing the current feature that you're working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is cloning a repo directly on the GitHub web server
A clone is cloning it from GitHub to your local HD or from local HD to local HD
A branch is creating a new series of commits on your local computer

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you can make changes to it without an internet connection
