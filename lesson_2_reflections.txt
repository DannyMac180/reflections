What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you bind all the files together
So that you can create commits which are a snapshot of 
The state of ALL the files together when the commit is made

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary location
That you can add separate files
So you can commit them either together
Or separately

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By making sure you only add files to the staging area
Where you've made logical changes, and leave the files
Where you haven't made logical changes in the working directory
visualize the branch structure?

A diagram gives you a grpahical display of the branches within your
Commit history so you can see how the different branches are related 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches essentially merges them both into the Master branch
While including the experimental or new branch within the Master branch
To create a new Master branch with new features

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Merging automatically can be convenient but it can be ambiguous
For git to know exactly which files you want to discard
And which files you want to keep
