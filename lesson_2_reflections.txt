What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you bind all the files together
So that you can create commits which are a snapshot of 
The state of ALL the files together when the commit is made

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary location
That you can add separate files
So you can commit them either together
Or separately
